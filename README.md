# JavaScript Console Sublime Text snippets

Snippets and Code completion for Sublime Text 2.

## Installing

Install through [Pacakege Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)

## Snippets

Snippets are the fastest way to code.
To trigger a method of the [Console API](http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API)
just put a `>` followed by it's name, like so:

`>log` expands to `console.log()`

`>info` expands to `console.info()`

You got the point.

## Code completion

If you're more into code completion, we got you covered too.
Just start typing the name of the method and the methods should start appearing.
